# ASVclustr
ASVclustr is an R package designed to cluster time series data of amplicon sequence variants by their population dynamics (i.e. increase or decrease in
abundance over time.). This is useful for modeling applications where dimensionality reduction is needed, such as generalized lotka volterra models.

It can also compare population dynamics of amplicon sequencing variants between experimental groups.
