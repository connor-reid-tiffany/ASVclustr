Description: ASVclustr is a toolkit for analyzing the population dynamics of amplicon sequencing variants. It provides functions for clustering ASVs by population dynamics, cluster validation, and a statsitical test for comparing population dynamics of clusters or individual ASVs between experimental groups.
